                        <h3 class="text-center text-warning" >Inpipe Inspection Robot For Crack Detection</h3>
                        <p>The project focused on the design and fabrication of an in-pipe inspection robot capable of navigating both vertical and horizontal sections of pipes. This robot was developed to enhance the inspection process for detecting cracks and other anomalies within the piping systems. A camera web server was integrated into the robot using an Arduino platform, and the visual feed was captured through an ESP32 camera. The live video stream from the camera was then processed using a Python program interfaced with the OpenCV library. This program was designed to analyze the feed in real time, using contour detection to accurately identify and differentiate cracks from the surrounding pipe structure. The implementation of this system provided a robust and efficient solution for conducting thorough inspections, ensuring the integrity of the piping network and enabling early detection of potential issues, which is crucial for maintaining the safety and longevity of the infrastructure.</p>

                        <p>In the 2023-2024 project titled "Sign Language Recognition," I developed an advanced system utilizing deep learning and computer vision to enhance communication accessibility. The core of this project was implementing YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection model, to accurately recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. By processing video feeds, the system identifies hand movements and translates them into text, enabling seamless communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This innovation not only fosters inclusivity but also improves user interaction by making digital platforms more accessible. The project showcases the potential of AI-driven technologies in bridging communication gaps and creating more equitable environments for all users.</p>

                        <p>The "Demographic Analysis of Region in Relevance to LSGD Election" project, conducted from 2020 to 2022, focused on data analysis to support electoral decision-making. Utilizing Pandas and NumPy, I meticulously prepared and cleaned extensive voter data, ensuring accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis. The project involved creating dynamic and insightful dashboards with Tableau, which visually represented key findings and demographic trends. These dashboards were instrumental in uncovering patterns and providing actionable insights. By analyzing voter demographics, the project contributed valuable information to inform strategies and decisions for the LSGD and Legislative elections. The comprehensive analysis helped stakeholders understand voter behaviors and preferences, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of campaign efforts and electoral planning.</p>
